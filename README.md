# Digital Signal Processing - Project

In this project we had an input signal (signal_033.wav) which contained two real audio signals modulated for double sideband reduced carrier transmission. The aim of the project is to extract the signals and remove any audible distortion. For more infos about the filters used and the results take a look at the report (candeo_giovanni.pdf).
